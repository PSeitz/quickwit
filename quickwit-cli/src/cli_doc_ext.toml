[index.create]
long_about = """
Creates an index at `index-uri` configured by a yaml file located at `index-config-uri`. The command fails if an index already exists at `index-uri` unless `overwrite` is passed. 
When `overwrite` is enabled, the command deletes all the files stored at `index-uri` before creating a new index. 
The index config defines how a document and fields it contains, are stored and indexed, see the [index config documentation](index-config.md).

[index.ingest]
long_about = """
Indexes a dataset consisting of newline-delimited JSON objects located at `input-path` or read from *stdin*. 
The data is appended to the target index specified by `index-uri` unless `overwrite` is passed. `input-path` can be a file or another command output piped into stdin. 
Currently, only local datasets are supported. 
By default, tantivy's indexer will work with a heap of 2 GiB of memory, but this can be set with the `heap-size` option in the indexing_settings.resources section in the config. 
This does not directly reflect the overall memory usage of `quickwit index ingest`, but doubling this value should give a fair approximation.

[index.gc]
note = """
Intermediate files are created while executing Quickwit commands. 
These intermediate files are always cleaned at the end of each successfully executed command. 
However, failed or interrupted commands can leave behind intermediate files that need to be removed. 
Also note that using very short grace-period (like seconds) can cause removal of intermediate files being operated on especially when using Quickwit concurently on the same index. 
In practice you can settle with the default value (1 hour) and only specify a lower value if you really know what you are doing.

[index.search]
long_about = """
Searches the index stored at `index-uri` and returns the documents matching the query specified with `query`. 
The offset of the first hit returned and the number of hits returned can be set with the `start-offset` and `max-hits` options. 
It's possible to restrict the search on specified fields using the `search-fields` option. 
Search can also be limited to a time range using the `start-timestamp` and `end-timestamp` options. 
These timestamp options can particularly be useful in boosting query performance when using a time series dataset and only need to query a particular window.

Starts a web server listening that exposes the [Quickwit REST API](search-api.md). 
The `default_index_root_uri` option in quickwit.yaml, specifies the parent folder of all indexes targeted by the API (e.g. s3://your-bucket/indexes). 
The node can optionally join a cluster using the `peer_seed` parameter (quickwit.yaml). 
This list of node addresses is used to discover the remaining peer nodes in the cluster through the use of a gossip protocol (SWIM).
